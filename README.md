The generic agent loop (prompting, retries, tool routing, file editing) is becoming infrastructure. Frontier models already plan, search repositories, use tools, and recover from mistakes. Model vendors are packaging native harnesses with file tools and sandbox execution. Competing there is a losing bet.

What remains strategically important is the **trust harness**: accurate repository context, permission and sandbox boundaries, exact validation against the changed code, risk-sensitive policies, CODEOWNERS and human approval, reproducible receipts, and independent evidence the model cannot award itself. Stronger models increase that need, because teams will let them change more code with less supervision.

**Òtítọ́** is that independent trust layer. It is local-first, deterministic, and model-agnostic: it discovers repositories, builds local indexes, generates task-aware context before an agent edits, scores how much a change actually touches, and gates merge readiness. It works the same way every time, with no server, no account, and no code leaving the machine. It does not compete with Codex, Claude Code, Gemini, Cursor, or future native harnesses. It integrates with them, and keeps working as models change underneath it.

## Trusted agent workflow

> **New in v1.9.0:** Herdr `model-route` (and the host-agnostic model-router skill) score Otito AX and recommend cheap / mid / premium before you spend tokens on an agent.

```text
Request -> context -> scoped change -> exact validation -> review evidence -> human decision
```

Otito helps the agent understand and bound a task before editing, then gives the maintainer evidence to decide whether to trust the result. A passing local gate is never an automatic merge approval: hosted CI, GitHub review, CODEOWNERS, and the human release decision remain separate authorities.

It does not try to replace native agent harnesses, `opensrc`, `code-structure`, Daytona, or Harnss. It gives developers and coding agents a single CLI that can:

Deterministic merge gates are the differentiated core. This is the human-in-the-loop checkpoint that a model cannot grade for itself:

- score merge readiness for local changes and pull requests with one `review_gate` tool (`gate` on the CLI)
- execute a protected validation plan against the exact staged tree and retain a bounded receipt of its outcomes
- bind staged web, API, and shared-contract changes into one workspace receipt
- resolve CODEOWNERS to required reviewers and surface owner-decision warnings
- check branch-protection expectations and required checks before merge
- generate actionable PR review context from git diffs and optional GitHub comments
- continuously prove the local gate against a committed valid control and adversarial change corpus with `otito eval --gate-effectiveness`

Local-first context feeds the gates:

- inspect a repository
- discover and index local repositories
- maintain a local catalog and search across it
- generate task-aware context packets before an agent plans or edits
- generate AST-backed JSON-first code maps for agents
- generate a setup/validation/runtime harness for a repo
- produce Markdown or JSON reports
- estimate context-token size for generated artifacts
- run an MCP server for agent hosts with a persisted per-user index cache that never dirties an inspected repository
- expose simple agent-friendly tool metadata
- check tool availability
- generate TypeScript structure HTML through `code-structure`
- search dependency source through `opensrc`

## Quick Start

Code maps use the TypeScript compiler for JS/TS and dedicated language extractors for Go, C#, Python, Java, Ruby, and Rust (see `src/lib/code-map/ast-languages.js`). Optional external tools are only needed for dependency-source lookup and HTML structure reports.

Install the published package from npm:

```bash
npm install -g @bashbop/otito
otito doctor
otito index ~/projects --discover
otito context "add a new MCP tool" --path .
```

You can also run a command without a global install:

```bash
npx -y @bashbop/otito doctor
```

For source development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BASHBOP/otito.git
cd otito
npm ci
npm run ci
node src/cli.js doctor
```

The current release is available through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bashbop/otito), [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BASHBOP/otito/releases), and the MCP Registry as `io.github.BASHBOP/otito`.

Run Otito as the trust layer inside a Herdr agent workspace:

```bash
herdr plugin install BASHBOP/otito/integrations/herdr
herdr plugin pane open --plugin bashbop.otito --entrypoint trust-status
```

The Herdr plugin uses the independently installed `otito` CLI. Herdr owns persistent agent terminals and worktrees; Otito owns context, impact, review, and deterministic gate evidence.

```bash
otito repo . --json
otito discover ~/projects --depth 2 --json
otito index ~/projects --discover
otito catalog
otito search "events controller"
otito context "add a new MCP tool" --path .
otito impact . "add a new MCP tool" --top 12
otito ax . "add a new MCP tool"
otito map . --json
otito harness . --out .otito/harness.md
otito pr . --base origin/main --out .otito/pr-review.md
otito review . --request "add a new MCP tool" --base origin/main
otito gate . --staged --base origin/main
otito gate . --staged --run-validation
otito mcp
otito report . --out .otito/report.md
otito workspace /path/to/web /path/to/api --out .otito/workspace.md
otito workspace-gate /path/to/web /path/to/api --request "ship the product change" --out .otito/workspace-gate.md
```

Optional external tools:

```bash
npm install -g opensrc code-structure
```

Then:

```bash
otito deps zod --query parse
otito structure . --out .otito/structure.html
```

## otito vs alternatives

| Approach | Strengths | Where otito differs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sourcegraph / Cody context | Powerful hosted code search and embedding-based context across an org | otito is local-first and deterministic: no server, no account, no code leaves the machine, and the same query always yields the same packet |
| Hand-written `CLAUDE.md` / rules files | Curated, intent-rich guidance | Hand-written context goes stale; otito regenerates context from the actual code (symbols, imports, routes, tests) on every run and complements a short `CLAUDE.md` |
| `grep` / `ripgrep` | Fast, universal text matching | otito ranks whole files by task intent across paths, symbols, exports, and tests, then adds patterns and validation commands. The result is a context packet, not a list of matching lines |

## Quality Gates

Use the full gate before opening a pull request or publishing a release:

```bash
npm run ci
```

The gate runs:

- `npm run format:check`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm run version:check`
- `npm test`
- `npm run test:coverage`
- `npm run eval:accuracy`
- `npm run eval:harness`
- `npm run eval:gate`
- `npm run audit`
- `npm run smoke`

Coverage currently gates source files at 70% lines, 60% branches, and 75% functions. Generated artifacts under `.otito/` are ignored by git, linting, and formatting; keep durable reports there instead of committing them.

The harness execution evaluation runs only vetted install, test, typecheck, and build commands against committed fixtures. It disables install lifecycle scripts, applies timeouts, and never executes inferred commands from a customer repository.

The gate-effectiveness evaluation creates isolated Git repositories from a committed base, applies reviewed change directories or patches, and invokes the real staged local gate. Its baseline proves one valid change is allowed and six known-bad changes are blocked for their encoded reasons. It cannot execute corpus-supplied commands or inspect a customer repository.

### Performance checks

Run the CLI benchmark when changing startup, repository scanning, or code-map behavior:

```bash
npm run benchmark:cli -- --iterations 5
npm run benchmark:cli -- --iterations 5 --json
```

It measures the lightweight `version` and `help` paths plus a full `context` run. Timings include Node startup and command execution. Compare results on the same machine and checkout; the benchmark reports measurements but does not enforce machine-dependent thresholds in CI.

otito follows Semantic Versioning. Pull requests should identify whether they are no-version-impact, patch, minor, or major changes; maintainers apply the final package version during release.

For longer trust-layer work, use the [Builder-Founder Operating Loop](docs/06-builder-founder-operating-loop/README.md) to keep every session tied to context, focused changes, visible gates, human decisions, and durable evidence.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and read [Contributor Governance](docs/03-contributor-governance/README.md) for review and merge rules.

Open an issue or draft PR for substantial changes, and run `npm run ci` before requesting review. All code changes must be reviewed by a maintainer/code owner before merge. The protected `main` branch requires maintainer approval, passing quality gates, and resolved PR conversations.

## Common Workflows

Agent repo harness:

```bash
otito harness . --out .otito/harness.md
otito map . --json
```

Local discovery, indexing, catalog, and search:

```bash
otito discover ~/projects --depth 2
otito index ~/projects --discover
otito catalog
otito search "submit rsvp"
```

Task-aware agent context:

```bash
otito context "add a new MCP tool" --path . --json
otito context "add a new MCP tool" --path . --out .otito/context-pack.md
```

PR review harness:

```bash
otito pr . --base origin/main --out .otito/pr-review.md
otito pr . --number 123 --comment
```

Merge gate (`gate` is the canonical v2 command; `pass` / `pass-pr` remain as legacy aliases):

```bash
otito gate . --base origin/main          # local gate (no GitHub)
otito gate . --staged --base origin/main # staged-path evidence, suitable for pre-commit hooks
otito gate . --staged --run-validation   # run the base-committed validation plan against the exact staged tree
otito gate . --base origin/main --request "update the greeting" --min-convergence 80
otito converge "update the greeting" --path . --base HEAD --staged --json # exact change-subject receipt
otito gate --pr 123 --path .             # GitHub PR gate via gh
```

In staged mode, changed-path, risk, secret and convergence evidence use the exact Git index tree. Exact-subject source analysis streams raw Git blobs and fails closed above 5,000 source files or 64 MiB. `--run-validation` additionally executes only a versioned plan from `otito.gate.json` in the selected base commit against an isolated copy of that staged tree. It records commands, exit outcomes and output hashes in a separate validation receipt; it never records raw output. Supported package-manager script forms include direct and `run` invocations for npm, pnpm, Yarn, Bun, and Corepack-wrapped commands. Their selected-base script identity is pinned, so a staged manifest cannot replace them with a no-op. Other base-committed commands remain valid policy commands; adding a new package-manager script form requires the same pinning semantics and regression coverage. Validation starts with a scrubbed environment and isolated home; only explicitly allowlisted variables pass through. The source snapshot is exact, while a linked local `node_modules` directory is explicitly reported as **not attested** in this first increment. Release and optional analyzer checks still inspect the working tree and remain outside that receipt.

Create the policy in the protected base branch before asking the gate to execute it:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "validation": {
    "environment": { "allow": ["TEST_DATABASE_URL"] },
    "commands": [{ "id": "unit", "command": "npm test", "timeoutSeconds": 300 }]
  }
}
```

`environment.allow` is optional. Use it only for the specific variables a protected validation plan requires; values are never recorded in the receipt.

Multi-repo product context:

```bash
otito workspace ../web ../api --out .otito/workspace.md
otito workspace-gate ../web ../api --base origin/main --request "ship Audience Studio preview" --out .otito/workspace-gate.md
```

`workspace-gate` creates one parent receipt across two or more staged repositories. It binds each repository's exact base, parent and staged-tree identity, changed-file scope, local-gate checks, and any validation receipt. All repositories must have a staged subject before the parent receipt is issued.

GitHub Actions bootstrap:

```bash
otito init /path/to/target-repo
```

Local Ollama review:

```bash
otito harness . --out .otito/harness.md

{
  echo "Use this repo harness to explain the project and suggest the next best engineering task."
  echo
  cat .otito/harness.md
} | ollama run qwen3:8b --think false --hidethinking --nowordwrap
```

Local Ollama PR review:

```bash
otito pr . --base origin/main --out .otito/pr-review.md

{
  echo "Review this PR context. Focus on bugs, missing tests, and risky changes."
  echo
  cat .otito/pr-review.md
} | ollama run qwen3:8b --think false --hidethinking --nowordwrap
```

## Commands

### `doctor`

Checks the local runtime and optional external tools.

```bash
otito doctor --json
```

### `install` / `i`

Prints install commands and current binary status. From a local checkout, `--global` runs `npm install -g .`; `--link` runs `npm link`.

```bash
otito install
otito i
otito install --global
otito install --json
```

After installation, use `otito` as the command.

### `repo <path>`

Inspects repo shape: files, package metadata, languages, package managers, scripts, likely entrypoints, git metadata, and ignored-heavy directories.

```bash
otito repo . --json
```

Git repositories are scanned through `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` so ignored files do not pollute harness context. Plain directories fall back to the built-in walker.

### `discover <root...>`

Discovers repository roots under one or more local directories without indexing them.

```bash
otito discover ~/projects --depth 2
otito discover . --json
```

Discovery stops at directories with common repo markers such as `package.json`, `.git`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, and `Package.swift`.

### `index <repo...>`

Generates per-user external indexes and adds repositories to the local catalog. The inspected repositories are not modified.

```bash
otito index .
otito index ~/projects --discover
otito index . --catalog /tmp/otito-catalog.json --json
```

The default catalog path is `~/.otito/catalog.json`. Set `OTITO_CATALOG` or pass `--catalog` to use a different file.

### `catalog`

Lists repositories currently indexed in the local catalog.

```bash
otito catalog
otito catalog --json
```

### `search <query>`

Searches indexed local repositories by path, domain, kind, route, controller path, imports, exports, and symbols.

```bash
otito search "events controller"
otito search "submit rsvp" --limit 10
otito search "api client" --offline --json
```

By default, search refreshes repo indexes when fingerprints change. Use `--offline` to read only the stored external indexes.

### `context <query>`

Generates a local context-engine packet for a task. The packet includes inferred intent, primary files, related files, matching tests, implementation patterns, validation commands, conflicts, source evidence, and token estimates.

```bash
otito context "add a new MCP tool" --path . --json
otito context "add a new CLI command" --path . --out .otito/context-pack.md
```

Use this before handing work to a coding agent. It is deterministic and local-first: it relies on repo indexes, code maps, import relationships, tests, and harness commands rather than an external model.

### `obsidian <repo>`

Exports an Obsidian-compatible Markdown vault from the repository map. The vault includes a navigable home note, repository files and entrypoints, an evidence index, and optional task-specific context and impact notes.

```bash
otito obsidian . --query "add a new MCP tool" --out .otito/obsidian
```

The default output directory is `.otito/obsidian`. The vault is a readable projection of Otito evidence; it does not replace exact staged-tree gates, hosted CI, CODEOWNERS, or human review.

### `harness <path>`

Generates a repo harness with setup commands, validation scripts, runtime scripts, context commands, focus areas, and estimated context-token usage.

```bash
otito harness . --out .otito/harness.md
otito harness . --json
```

Use this as the first artifact an agent or CI workflow reads before touching code.

### `init <path>`

Scaffolds otito into another repository.

```bash
otito init /path/to/target-repo
otito init /path/to/target-repo --force
otito init /path/to/target-repo --no-workflow
otito init /path/to/target-repo --tool-repo BASHBOP/otito --tool-ref main
```

Generated files:

- `.otito/README.md`
- `.github/workflows/otito-ci.yml`

The generated workflow runs on pull requests and commit pushes. Pull request runs generate the report, upload an artifact, and create or update a sticky PR comment. Push runs generate and upload the report artifact without commenting.

### `structure <path>`

Runs `code-structure` against TypeScript files.

```bash
otito structure . --pattern "app/**/*.tsx" --out .otito/structure.html
```

If `code-structure` is missing, the command returns an install hint instead of failing mysteriously. If it is not installed globally but `npx` is available, otito can run it through `npx --yes code-structure`.

### `deps <package>`

Uses `opensrc path <package>` to resolve dependency source and optionally search it.

```bash
otito deps zod --query parse --limit 20
```

### `report <path>`

Generates a shareable developer report.

```bash
otito report .
otito report . --out .otito/report.md
otito report . --json
```

The default output is formatted for terminal reading and ends with estimated token usage. Use `--out` for the Markdown artifact or `--json` for structured data.

### `workspace <repo...>`

Generates one product-level report across related repos.

```bash
otito workspace /path/to/web /path/to/api --out .otito/workspace.md
otito workspace /path/to/web /path/to/api --json
```

### `pr <path>`

Generates a PR review context pack from local git diff metadata, code-map classification, review targets, targeted review prompts, risk flags, suggested verification commands, estimated tokens, and optional GitHub PR comments.

```bash
otito pr . --base origin/main --out .otito/pr-review.md
otito pr . --number 123 --comment
```

Useful flags:

- `--base <ref>`: compare from a specific base ref. Defaults to PR base, upstream, `origin/main`, or `main`.
- `--head <ref>`: compare to a specific head ref. Defaults to `HEAD`.
- `--number <n>`: enrich with `gh pr view` metadata and review comments.
- `--github`: ask `gh` to infer the PR from the current branch.
- `--comment`: create or update a sticky GitHub PR comment using `gh`.

### GitHub Actions

This repo includes `.github/workflows/otito-ci.yml`. The workflow installs dependencies, runs `npm run ci`, then generates PR or push review context as an uploaded artifact. Use `otito init /path/to/target-repo` to scaffold an Otito review workflow into another repository.

### `mcp`

Starts a stdio MCP server exposing otito as agent-callable tools. MCP repo-map lookups use an external per-user cache with a file fingerprint, refresh when files change, and never write into the inspected repository.

The server is published in the MCP Registry as `io.github.BASHBOP/otito`.

```bash
otito mcp
```

When wiring it into an MCP host (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "otito": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bashbop/otito", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you prefer a globally installed binary:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "otito": {
      "command": "otito",
      "args": ["mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Ollama can provide the local model, but it does not call MCP tools by itself. To use otito through MCP with a local model, use an MCP-capable agent client that supports Ollama as the model provider and configure the `otito` server above.

Òtítọ́ exposes **13** MCP tools for repository inspection, context, impact, review, and merge evidence.

| `workspace_report`  | Product-level report across multiple repos                                         |
| `repo_harness`      | Setup, validation, runtime, and context commands for an agent or CI harness        |

### `matrix`

Prints the tool evaluation matrix for Greploop, `code-structure`, `opensrc`, Daytona, and Harnss.

### `agent-tools`

Prints JSON or Markdown metadata derived from the canonical MCP tool catalog, keeping CLI and MCP integrations aligned.

## Strategy

Wrap first. Measure pain. Build only the missing pieces.

This keeps the project useful quickly while leaving room to replace weak adapters with owned implementations later.

## Part of the toolchain

**otito** is one of four tools that form a deterministic trust layer for AI-assisted development. Each uses static analysis to answer a question people keep handing to an LLM.

- **otito** (this tool), for context: what does this change actually touch?
- [tieline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bashbop/tieline), for contracts: did the front end and back end quietly stop agreeing?
- [bouncer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bashbop/bouncer), for compliance: could you defend this to Ofcom?
- [aiglare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bashbop/aiglare), for governance: where can the model do something you can't undo?

More at [segunolumbe.com](https://segunolumbe.com). _static analysis, never the model._
