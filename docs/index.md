# :material-source-branch: Òtítọ́

## Independent trust infrastructure for agents and reviewers

**Prepared by:** Oluwasegun Olumbe<br>
**Status:** v1.9.0 published to npm, GitHub Releases, and the official MCP Registry<br>
**Category:** Practical AI governance for developers

> A Bashbop Ltd product for teams that want any coding agent to produce evidence a human can trust before merge.

!!! info "About Òtítọ́"
    Òtítọ́ is a local-first trust harness for coding agents. It maps repository context before a change, then produces deterministic impact, validation, ownership, and review evidence before merge. It complements model-native agent loops instead of replacing them.

    Its command-line and package identity is `otito`.

    :material-animation-play: See the [**How It Works** visual walkthrough](assets/otito-how-it-works.html) — a layered diagram of the discover → index → context → gate flow.

## What's New

!!! tip "v1.9.0 published (2026-09-06)"
    - Herdr `model-route` recommends cheap / mid / premium from Otito AX before starting an agent.
    - Host-agnostic `model-router` skill for Cursor, Codex, Claude Code, Herdr, and peers.
    - Herdr docs cover optional `prefix+m` binding beside review and staged gate.

## Quick Start

=== "Install"

    ```bash
    npm install -g @bashbop/otito@1.9.0
    otito doctor
    otito context "review this change" --path .
    ```

=== "No Global Install"

    ```bash
    npx -y @bashbop/otito@1.9.0 doctor
    ```

=== "Source Checkout"

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BASHBOP/otito.git
    cd otito
    npm ci
    npm run ci
    node src/cli.js doctor
    ```

=== "MCP"

    ```bash
    otito mcp
    ```

Prove the deterministic merge gate against the committed valid and adversarial corpus:

```bash
otito eval --gate-effectiveness
```
